# Dotfiles

## Introduction

Welcome to my config files for raspberry pi 3b+ and Arch linux. 
- I use my raspberry pi as a samba server as well as an adblocker based on dns spoofing.
- I use Arch Linux on daily bases. However, there are something that I must use windows,
  like `Adobe .*`, `WeChat`, and other proprietory softwares. So I am actually dual boot.

### Virtualization

I have 3 different virtual machine configuration:
    - bare QEMU (current in use & recommended)
    - libvirtd based qemu
    - and vmware based
Since I am dual booted with windows and Arch, one should consider bare qemu which take
advantage of that as a good option. Before you deploy that, please modify disk table 
according to your machine with `sudo parted /dev/sda unit s print`. Then you may execute 
`sudo init.sh` as well as `qemu.sh` to install and start your windows virtual machine

### X & Wayland

I use both X and wayland, because some application is just more stable on X compared to 
Wayland (or only available, e.g., `xfreerdp`). However, one can disable or enable X or
Wayland environment variable by just creating a `env` file that start with `# disabled`.

I will try to make a better implementation of choice in `dotbot` as a plugin. For now,
let's stick with this stupid `bash` script solution.

### Fcitx5

As everyone knows, typing CJK/Espa√±ol/or any language that requires dead key(s) is very difficult
in Linux. For example, my terminal kitty + vim won't work with this solution (without all 
those environment variables). But know we can have all of those just by execute install. 
I mention it here because I understand you may not need to type those weird characters at all, 
so, you may wish to remove them!

### Font

- Fira Code 12px - 14px - 16px
- Google Material Icon Font
- Exhaustive list in provided at `desktop/theme/font/pkgs.yaml`

### AUR helper

- Make sure you have `yay` installed. Our script does not throw an error if failed to do so.
- Implementation details is available at `plugin/package.py`. It has the following properties
    - Concurrent
    - Indempotent
    - `pacman` and `yay` compatible
- One may group packages with dict (as folders). This program always install all the leaf node
  in the `pkg.yaml` file. One may specify backend and/or specify whether to install a batch of
  programs at once. Just take a look at `package.py` and you will see how it works.

### Future

- We will move to `Ansible` eventually. This dot file manager grows in complexity, and would 
  eventually become a click and configure a new Arch Distro stuff. That being said, this
  Python script and Bash script solution works now, but eventually, growing bigger and bigger
  that we must use other solutions.
